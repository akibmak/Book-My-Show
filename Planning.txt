    -> WE need a reusable carousel
        1. Common carousel
        2. Hero carousel
        3. Cast and Crew small carousel

    -> Pages
        1. Home Page
        2. Movie Page
        3. Categories Page
        4. Auth Page
        5. Razorpay Payment Gateway

    -> How are we going to build it ??? ğŸ¤”
        1. Layouts 
        2. Routes 
        3. Pages
        4. Components
        5. API's (TMDB, Razorpay)


# Some Theory

    //HOC
        -> Higher order Components to handle our Layouts

    //Layout First Approach
        -> instead of whole content of the page to get updated/rendered again we only render the required changes
            we can either use pops if changes are minimal
            or if changes are too much we can create required Component
